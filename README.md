# Loan_Classification_using_SQL_Server_R_services
Building a in database prediction model to leverage SQL Server 2016 as a Scoring Engine to predict "bad" loans

Part 1 Project backgroud and value position

R Services (In-database) provides a platform for developing and deploying intelligent applications that uncover new insights. We can use the rich and powerful R language and the many packages from the community to create models and generate predictions using our SQL Server data. Because R Services (In-database) integrates the R language with SQL Server, we can keep analytics close to the data and eliminate the costs and security risks associated with data movement.

Part 2 Steps to build 
(1) Data Preprocess: create a table to ingratate the required data
(2) Feature selection
(3) Spilting the data
(4) Building the predictive model
(5) Scoring loans 
(6) Model evaluation
